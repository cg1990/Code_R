The mainparties are the future owners. In the next step, we will make a financial plan with the owners and we will also discuss the design.
During the mapping phase we first visit the building from the outside and verify the drawings from the existing building. With the drawing we make a mapping of the original situation. We do this together with the energy adviser. After that we make the energy simulation and create the BIM models. We will also start the allocation plan and noise studies. The noise studies starts raffs. Later we will contact experts for a more detailed study.
The modelling and the mapping phase goes hand in hand.
The projects is located in a very good infrastructure with a lot of space around the building. The roof-top retrofitting could be a complete unit or a 2d component. Maybe we also use the robot insulation technique. From the project side we have information about exact measurement of the rooftop, plans about the mainconstruction and the existing foundation.
For the monitoring we could use the comfort eye. For the installation of the comfort eye and other monitoring tools we need the help of experts. The monitoring would lead to further interventions in the building. We need to be awared of this.
