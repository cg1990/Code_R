The mainparties are the future owners.
Mapping In the next step, we make a financial plan with the owners and we discuss the design.
During the mapping phase we first visit the building from the outside and verify the drawings from the existing building.
With the drawing we make a mapping of the original situation.   
We do this together with the energy adviser.
After that we make the energy simulation and create the BIM models.
We  start the allocation plan and noise studies. The noise studies starts raffs. Later we contact experts for a more detailed study.
The modelling and the mapping phase goes hand in hand.
The projects is located in a very good infrastructure with a lot of space around the building.
The roof-top retrofitting could be a complete unit or a 2d component.
Maybe we use the robot insulation technique. From the project side we have information about exact measurement of the rooftop, plans about the mainconstruction and the existing foundation.
For the monitoring we could use the comfort eye.
For the installation of the comfort eye and other monitoring tools we need the help of experts.
The monitoring would lead to further interventions in the building. We need to be awared of this.

We are still discussing the site. The demo project be a school building. But we still need to decide, which one we choose.
If we take the nursery school NEMO, we must replace the heating system. We replcae the single class windows.
We need to be very carefull during the renovation because the building is under cultural heritage.
Another problem could be the big control heating system with manual regulation.
For the BIM model we are currently make a approach. For the renovation we make choose some good solutions out of the P2Endure project.
If it it possible, we want to integrate the windows from BGTech.
If we be able to renovate the second school, we need to renovate the bathrooms. We want to hire external partners to do the safety check.
For the external partners we need to have a tender. The best offer in terms of price and quality  get the contract.
The tender  be placed by the municipality. So we do not need consultants to make an offer.
At this time, we do not slip into the mapping or the modelling phase. First we need to finished the BIM model. The modelling is based on the data and structural drawings of the building.
For the making process we integrate products from the P2Endure project.
We need to concluse a subcontract to do the mountings on the building.
We want to evaluate the energy of the building. Maybe we are install some monitoring equipment. But we are definetly install monitoring equipment to measure the gas consumption and the 
external  temparatur radiators. For us it is difficult to plan the future interventions because of the planing horizon.

We started laser scanning.
The architekt start to do the sketch-up Model to convert it into the BIM Model.
We need to make all isntallations. It is difficult to scan the whole building. Hopefully we are done with that at the end of January.
The building was constracted in 1965. The volume is 2712 tripplemeter with space for 130 children.
On the outside of the building is no isolation.
The building itself is connceted with another building.
One of the buildings is for the kitchen. The other one is for the children.
The installation of the windows is quite difficult.
The wall must have a retrofit.
The design of the building will be shown the city of Gdynia in November or December.
The whole construction process depends on the budget.
The architekts make the desing. The engineers will check the price and the costs.
The problem with the budget are the windows because there are a lot of windows which need to be changed.
The municipality makes the decision. After that it takes a year. If the tender is done the contract with the cheapest price will be choosen.
Within the mapping phase we screen the costs of the technology. 
We start the planing for the intervention.
We clrearly need to know the prices and the workflow fot the renovation.
The kindergarten is open the whole year. The retrofitting can only take place in July or August.
Within the modelling phase we do a laser scan. The building structure is very simple. After that we create the BIM model.
We create the BIM model with sketch up or revit. This will be done by our inhouse architect.
The kindergarten we be closed for two month during the renovation. 
Supply chain consideration should be done.
The monitoring is simular to all other demo buildings. We need to know what we need to monitor and which values we should monitor.
We also need to know how we can get the data from the sensors and when.
After the we have the measurement plan we have no constraints with the privacy. The sensors could easily be installed.

We met the owner of the building and start the datacollection.
"The demo projects are social houses: two building from the beginning of the 80s; 250 appartments the first; the other 180"
We want to renovate both buildings. 
"A lot of stduies and measurments are already done; buildings are the same; been done together in the same time (measurements are the same)"
"Problems: context; indoor quality"
The prefab, panels with structural panels can not be removed.
We also want to change windows and the boilers.
An architect for the aestetic of the building.
"budget: about 2 millionen; not confirmed yet; because of the earthquake the money might not be available now;"
The tender run about 3 months.
The renovation starts in sept 2018 end ends in 2019.
Important: university did a lot of studies during the last 10 years. Thats why we have alot of informations
" all materials; drawings; thermal conflicts; winter/sommer termal performance envelope; model of building; window simulation"
Infos about the technology electricity are stil missing.
" 15 cm of instalation material is to much (because of technical reasons); better 10 cm;"
The tender will be done by municipality. They need a building permit. So first they must create a design buildign permit
For the mapping we have no no feasibility studie.
We  install  sensors.
The physical installation of the sensors wll be done in 150 different appartments to cover all the possible conditions in the building.
We also collect the data from outdoor weather station.
"2-3 weeks of monitoring for each season; all done by recordes at the university server M. Sc. thesis, also one PH. D."
For the modelling phase we use a a design builder.
We do the simulation with Energy+
For the Input we use the geometrical inforamtion and the material of the building. We have 5 different types of walls.
This is also done by university together with company results of building.
The making is done by the contractor. There is much space to apply the insulation.
We need to monitor the energy part.
Each apartment has a gas boiler . Therefore we must install about 100 heatmeters. This is not feasable.
It is very difficult to measure all single boilers. The same is with the electricity.
It is hard to get information from the people who live there.
Also performance of the envelope will be measured.
